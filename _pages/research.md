      <span class="paper-title">Integration and Segregation: Selective Mobilization of Motherhood in Colonial Korea (1937–1945)</span>

      <p>
        The end of the Cold War has enabled East Asia to critically reassess the enduring scars and legacies of Japanese colonialism. Considerable research has been conducted on the "comfort women" system and forced labor, yet relatively little attention has been paid to the mobilization of women on the home front, and their specific roles within wartime society.
        <br><br>

        This study focuses on the wartime mobilization of motherhood in colonial Korea, analyzing how the Japanese Empire, between 1937 and 1945, redefined and mobilized the maternal roles of Korean women through policy and propaganda. Drawing on wartime newspapers and magazines, it investigates how colonial authorities reshaped normative expectations of motherhood, integrating women’s maternal functions into both the total war system and the imperialization movement (kōminka).
