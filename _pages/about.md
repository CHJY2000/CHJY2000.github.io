Hi! I am currently a Research Intern at the headquarters of the [United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)](https://www.undp.org/), working under the supervision of Kapto Serge. 

I graduated from the [Campus Asia Program](https://gsis.snu.ac.kr/campus-asia-program/) in July 2025, through which I obtained an M.A. in International Politics from [Peking University](https://www.sis.pku.edu.cn/en/) and a double degree in Public Policy from [the University of Tokyo](https://www.pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/overview/), while also studying as an exchange student at [Seoul National University](https://gsis.snu.ac.kr/). Previously, I received my B.A. in International Politics and Economics [(double degree)](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) from Peking University in 2022.
