Outside of my academic life, I enjoy translation, photography, learning new languages, reading detective novels, and watching figure skating competitions. (My favorite skates are [Chaeyeon KIM](https://isu-skating.com/figure-skating/skaters/chaeyeon-kim/), [Rika KIHIRA](https://isu-skating.com/figure-skating/skaters/Rika-KIHIRA/)  and [Yi ZHU](https://isu-skating.com/figure-skating/skaters/yi-zhu/).)
