Outside of my academic life, I enjoy translating, photography, learning new languages, reading detective novels, and watching figure skating competitions.

### ✏️ Translation
I am a passion-driven Japanese translator, and my first translation work, *[The Eternity Mansion Murders](https://book.douban.com/subject/37436578/)*, is scheduled to be published at the end of 2025.

### 🌏 Language Learning

I speak Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean fluently, and I’m beginner in Spanish.

I enjoy learning new languages, and I also aim to help others master them more effectively through [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). I’ve shared several memorization [decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1498351139) for English learners, and I’m currently developing decks based on the [*Sino-Japanese-Korean Shared Character Dictionary*](https://www.tcs-asia.org/data/etcData/PUB_1655945242.pdf)!

### 📷 Photography

I am a recreational photographer, and capturing the beauty of the world always refreshes me.

You can find more photos on my [personal website](https://www.hereischjy.blog/Photography/EN/)!

### ⛸️ Figure Skating

I love watching figure skating competitions and capturing the skaters’ most impressive moments.

My favorite skates are [Chaeyeon KIM](https://isu-skating.com/figure-skating/skaters/chaeyeon-kim/), [Rika KIHIRA](https://isu-skating.com/figure-skating/skaters/Rika-KIHIRA/) and [Yi ZHU](https://isu-skating.com/figure-skating/skaters/yi-zhu/).
