Outside of my academic life, I enjoy hiking, translation, photography, language learning, reading detective novels, and watching figure skating competitions.

### ✏️ Translation
I am a passion-driven Japanese translator, and my first work, *[The Eternity Mansion Murders](https://book.douban.com/subject/37436578/)*, was published in Mainland China in November, 2025.

### 🌏 Language Learning

I am a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese and fluent in English, Japanese, and Korean, with beginner-level proficiency in Spanish.

I enjoy learning and teaching languages, and I’m passionate about helping others study more effectively with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). I’ve shared several vocabulary [decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1498351139) for English and Japanese learners, and I’m currently developing new ones based on the [*Chinese-Japanese-Korean Shared Character Dictionary*](https://www.tcs-asia.org/data/etcData/PUB_1655945242.pdf)!
